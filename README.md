Introduction
============

What is it?
-----------
The kernel.css library is a unintrusive, lightweight and semantic CSS library. It uses prefixes for all it's classes and is meant to be
a simple foundation to your project.

Features
--------
 * Grid system with 12 columns.
 * Flexbox support.
 * Responsive design.
 * Navigation with four preset sizes (ke-header-xs, ke-header-sm, ke-header-lg, ke-header-xl).
 * Cubic-bezier transitions.

Why was it created?
-------------------
kernel.css was created to be a simple, lightweight CSS library that could be used as a baseline for my other projects.
It is meant to be unintrusive, and not get in the way of your own styles.

It's far from finished
------------------------
The kernel.css framework is an ever evolving project, and will
continue to be improved upon. I hope you will find it useful.

Installation
============
Simple. Just include this tag in your html.
```html
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/christian-dale/kernel.css@2.0.0/build/kernel.min.css" />
```

Navigation code example
-----------
```html
<body class="ke-base">
  <header class="ke-header ke-header-sm">
    <div class="ke-container">
	  <input class="ke-nav-toggle" id="ke-nav-toggle" type="checkbox">
	  <label for="ke-nav-toggle" class="ke-nav-toggle-hamburger"><span>â˜°</span></label>

	  <nav class="ke-nav">
	    <ul>
